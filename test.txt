International Women's Day (IWD) is celebrated annually on March 8th, and one of the most recognizable symbols of the day is its color scheme. The colors used for IWD are purple, green, and white, and each color has a specific significance.

Purple represents justice and dignity. This color was chosen because it symbolizes the historical struggles that women have faced, particularly in the fight for suffrage. Purple is a color that has long been associated with royalty and nobility, which are qualities that were denied to women for much of history. The color purple reminds us of the importance of recognizing and honoring the contributions of women throughout history and continuing to fight for gender equality.

Green represents hope. This color represents the hope for a brighter future for women around the world. It is a reminder that even though there is still work to be done to achieve gender equality, progress is being made. Green is also a symbol of nature and growth, and it reminds us that just like nature, progress takes time and patience.

White represents purity and new beginnings. This color was chosen as a symbol of the women's suffrage movement, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom. During suffrage marches and protests, women often wore white as a symbol of their purity and their commitment to the cause. White also represents a clean slate and a new beginning, which is important in the context of IWD because it reminds us that there is always an opportunity to start fresh and work towards a better future.

Together, the colors purple, green, and white represent the past, present, and future of women's empowerment. They remind us of the struggles that women have faced throughout history, the progress that has been made, and the work that still needs to be done to achieve gender equality.
