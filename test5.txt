1. Identify the opensource repository and fork it to the "publicgithub-level01" organization
2. Clone the PGFR (Public Github Forked Repo) and change the origin to "vgithub-level02" and push it to the "vgithub-level02" repo

git clone https://github.com/publicgithub-level01/Data-Structures-And-Algorithm.git
git config --get remote.origin.url
git branch

git remote rm origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/vgithub-level02/https-gitData-Structures-And-Algorithm.git
git config --get remote.origin.url
git branch
git push origin --all
======

3. Add the PGFR as a upstream to keep "vgithub-level02" repo in snyc with PGFR 
git remote add upstream https://github.com/publicgithub-level01/Data-Structures-And-Algorithm.git
git pull upstream master
git push --set-upstream origin master
======

4. Once the changes and the scans are completed again origin will be updated to PGFR and the code will be pushed
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/publicgithub-level01/Data-Structures-And-Algorithm.git
git config --get remote.origin.url
git branch
git push origin --all
=====
5. Once everything looks good raise PR to opensource repo from PGFR

Change the upstream if required
git remote set-url upstream https://github.com/publicgithub-level01/Data-Structures-And-Algorithm.git
